"""Namespace inspection for the variable explorer.

Runs inside the kernel, called through `user_expressions` on a silent
execute_request - so nothing here ever appears in the console transcript or
moves the In[n] counter.

Three rules shape it:

* Listing must stay cheap. It runs after every execution, on every name in the
  namespace, so it only reads what is already there - type, length, a short
  repr. Nothing that computes geometry.
* Expanding a row may do a little more work, but only a little. It is one
  click, the user cannot see what it will cost, and the cost scales with their
  model - so what a click can buy is bounded, and what does not fit is
  reported as missing rather than waited for.
* Anything genuinely expensive is not offered at all. Measured on a suspension
  assembly, and none of it cached: bounding_box() 19.1 s, volume 2.8 s, area
  2.2 s, the topology counts 0.8 s together. The first exceeded the sidecar's
  whole inspection budget and hung the pane; the next two are five seconds
  after a click. They belong in the console, where the user asks for them and
  can see what they cost. See _build123d_details.

Everything crossing back to the sidecar goes as a JSON string, never as a
Python object. user_expressions results are rendered by IPython's pretty
printer, which truncates any sequence at 1000 items by emitting a literal
"...", and ast.literal_eval on the far side happily reads that as Ellipsis -
which json.dumps then refuses, on every idle, for ever. Reproduced against the
pinned environment: 1200 rows in, 1001 out, the last one Ellipsis. A single
string has nothing for the printer to truncate.

    Three measurements on a suspension assembly decided what is here, and all
    three are per-expansion - OCCT caches none of them, so a second look costs
    the same as the first:

        bounding_box()  19.1 s
        volume           2.8 s
        area             2.2 s
        faces/edges/vertices, together   0.8 s

    So only the counts remain. bounding_box() alone exceeded the sidecar's
    fifteen-second inspection budget, which is what made the pane say "loading"
    for ever; volume and area were another five seconds between them, and five
    seconds after a click is not a pane anyone would call working. The counts
    describe the shape well enough to tell two versions of a model apart, which
    is what this pane is for.

    What is gone is not lost, only no longer automatic: rc.volume in the console
    answers in under three seconds, on request, where the cost is visible and
    the user has asked for it. The viewer already shows the extent that
    bounding_box() would report, and show() prints it.

    The budget stays even though everything left is well inside it. These are
    other people's objects and the next one may not be a Compound - a property
    that runs a solver, or a __getattr__ that does something expensive, costs
    nothing to bound and would otherwise be the same bug again.
