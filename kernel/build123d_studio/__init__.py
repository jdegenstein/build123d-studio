"""build123d Studio's kernel-side API: show() and friends.

This host is a transport and a settings source. Everything above that - the
show family, the configuration semantics, the tessellation, the camera policy,
the measurement backend - is `ocp_viewer_core`, shared with OCP CAD Viewer for
VS Code, the standalone viewer and Jupyter CadQuery, so that the same script
behaves the same way in all four.

`from build123d_studio import show` sits beside `from ocp_vscode import show`
and `from ocp_viewer import show`. Per-host imports, deliberately: a single
universal import with the host discovered at runtime makes cross-talk
representable, and there is a receipt - with a VS Code viewer on the default
port, this application's `show()` once silently drew into *that* viewer.

The names below are bound methods off one `Viewer` and one `Config`, never
`partial` and never `@wraps`: a bound method hovers with the full signature,
`self` gone and `config` invisible, which is what gives 90 keyword parameters
working completion in the editor.
