"""build123d-studio sidecar.

Spawned by the webview once the Python environment exists, and owns everything
Python-side: the kernel, the console's pty, and (later) the model socket and
measurement backend.

Started by the frontend rather than declared as a Neutralino extension because
on first run the venv this process lives in does not exist yet - the frontend
has to create it before anything here can be launched.

Talks to the webview over a WebSocket on a random loopback port, announced on
stdout at startup. See channel.py.

# Running code, and the working directory that goes with it. Both reach the
# kernel's shell socket, which is shared and can legitimately be held for
# seconds - a restart owns it outright for as long as the kernel takes to come
# back - so neither belongs on the receive thread.
#
# That is what turned a stuck shell socket into a dead application rather than a
# slow one. on_execute blocked the receive thread, the webview's frames stopped
# being read, and websockets' keepalive closed the link twenty seconds later:
# console keystrokes, the variable explorer and Restart Kernel all went with it,
# and none of them had anything to do with the kernel being stuck.

# would queue behind an expansion that can legitimately take fifteen seconds,
# and on the execute lane behind a Run.
COMPLETE = "complete"

# Measurement gets one of its own, and the reason is two-fold. Its warm-up waits
# for a reply that cannot come until OCP has loaded in the other process - two
# to four seconds - and on a shared lane that is time the variable explorer's
# first refresh spends queued behind it. And a measure click has always waited
# behind whatever the explorer had already asked for, which the comment on
# _pending_details describes as a cost worth coalescing around; it stops being a
# cost at all once the two do not share.
MEASURE = "measure"

# Formatting gets one too, and for the opposite reason to completion's: it is
# not that the answer goes stale, it is that the answer can be slow. Formatting
# is the one request here whose cost grows with the file, and on the complete
# lane a slow one would stall every suggestion typed while it ran - for work the
# user asked for once and is waiting on anyway.
FORMAT = "format"

# Debugging gets a lane of its own because starting a session blocks: the
# process is spawned and then dialled back to, which is under a second when it
# works and up to thirty when it does not. Neither belongs in front of a
# keystroke, and neither belongs behind a fifteen-second inspection.
DEBUG = "debug"


# The most suggestions one reply carries. `import ` alone offers 394 on this

# grows - which is how a suggestion list is meant to narrow anyway.

# The refresh that follows an idle is answered by a kernel that has just gone
# idle, so its reply is immediate or it is not coming. Fifteen seconds is right

# The socket dying is not the window dying: a machine waking from sleep resets

# within about ten seconds - after which the kernel, the console, the language
# server and the namespace are all exactly where they were. This has to be
# comfortably longer than that.
#
# It matters at all because nothing else ends this process when a window goes
# without closing its stdin - a page reload does that, and so does killing the

        **Once, whoever asks.** A quit asks twice by design - the frontend sends
        `shutdown` and then closes stdin, so that a webview which dies before the
        frame lands is still heard - and this used to run the whole chain on both
        threads at the same time. That is how seven sidecars came to outlive
        their application on this machine, each holding a kernel, a console and a
        measurement backend: the two runs met in the middle, each waiting on
        something the other had already taken.

        Losing that race is worse than it sounds, and the reason is upstream:
        websockets creates its connection thread **non-daemon**
        (`sync/server.py:285`, 16.1.1). So the frame's handler runs stop() on a
        thread the interpreter will *join* on the way out - and when the stdin
        path finished first and returned, CPython's own teardown then waited for
        ever on a thread stuck inside the same shutdown. Nothing was left to log
        it: from the outside the process simply stayed.

        So: one owner, the second caller waits for it and finds it done, and both
        paths end in os._exit rather than in an interpreter teardown that joins
        somebody else's thread.

        **And bounded.** Every step below is meant to return, but "meant to" is
        what the orphans disproved, so a watchdog leaves anyway and says which
        step it was on. Every child holds a contract that takes it with us - the
        kernel's parent poller, the language server's processId, the console's
        pty, the supervisors' pipes - so exiting is enough to take the tree.

        **What this does not reach**, by decision rather than oversight: any
        process the user's own code started. A subprocess opened in a cell, in a
        Run File script or under the debugger is stopped only as a courtesy, by
        the group kill on the graceful path, and a child that has left the group
        escapes even that. Nothing here hunts for it, and no later start sweeps
        for it either - a process id is reused, and killing the wrong one is
        worse than leaving the right one. See requs.md, Phase 6.
