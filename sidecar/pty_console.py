"""Run the patched jupyter console under a pseudo-terminal.

The console pane is a real terminal, not a REPL widget, so the process on the
other end needs a tty: prompt_toolkit only turns on its full line editor,
history search and completion menus when it is talking to one. A plain pipe
would degrade IPython to a dumb readline-less prompt, which is exactly the
"not an IPython feeling" this design is avoiding.

Bytes flow to and from xterm.js in the webview, base64-wrapped because the
webview link is a text channel.
