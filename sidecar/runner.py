"""Run a file - or a folder of tests - in a process of its own, with no debugger.

The other half of the two worlds the debugger established. Run All sends the
buffer's text to the kernel and leaves its names in the namespace the console
shares; Run File runs the *file*, in a process that is gone when it ends. What
that buys is the same thing debugging buys: the run cannot leave anything
behind, and what ran is exactly what is on disk.

It is deliberately not DebugSession with a flag. Everything that makes that
class delicate - binding a port, waiting for debugpy to dial back, relaying DAP
both ways, the ordering rule about `initialized` - exists only because there is
a debugger on the other end. Take it away and what is left is spawn, read, wait,
kill, which is short enough to read in one go and has no protocol to get wrong.

What is shared is the part that must not diverge: the interpreter, from
debug_python, and the environment, which is the kernel's - so a `show()` in the
file reaches the same viewer, exactly as it does from a paused frame.

pytest is the same three lines with a different argv, which is why it lives here
rather than in a module of its own: one child at a time, one output stream, one
Stop. What it is *not* is a test framework this application knows anything
about - there is no result parsing, no tree of tests and no green ticks. pytest
prints its own report, and the report is the feature.
