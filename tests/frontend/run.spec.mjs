/** The five run actions, as chords a person presses.
 *
 * `keys.js` already tests chord parsing and `editor/cells.js` tests where a
 * cell begins and ends, both as pure functions. Neither can answer the question
 * that actually matters here, which is whether pressing the chord runs the
 * right text - that needs Monaco to have registered the action, the keybinding
 * to have survived the platform mapping, and the cell arithmetic to have been
 * applied to the buffer the user is looking at.
 *
 * It has gone wrong before in exactly that gap: a chord named in the New File
 * template but attached to the wrong action is something the pure tests
 * explicitly cannot catch, and it shipped once.
 *
 * What is asserted is the frame that leaves for the sidecar. The kernel's half
 * - that it ran and printed In[n] - belongs to tests/integration.py, which has
 * a real kernel; this suite has a fake sidecar and can only speak for the
 * frontend's end. Both halves are worth having and neither substitutes.
 *
 * Proved by un-applying, once, when each case was written: the guard taken out
 * of the shipped source, the suite run, the file put back. What was removed,
 * and what went red:
 *
 * - src/keys.js, run.cell's shift+enter swapped for ctrl/mod+enter -
 *   Shift-Enter runs the cell, Ctrl-Enter stays
 * - src/editor/monaco.js, the `code.trim() === ""` guard - a buffer with
 *   nothing but blank lines sends nothing
