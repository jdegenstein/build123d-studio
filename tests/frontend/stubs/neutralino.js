 *
 * That boundary is small and knowable. The application uses about thirty of
 * Neutralino's functions and they are enumerated below; anything it grows later
 * lands here as an explicit "not stubbed" failure rather than as undefined,
 * because a native call that silently answers undefined is how a harness comes
 * to certify a path it never ran.
 *
 * The filesystem is a Map of absolute paths. It is deliberately not a real one:
 * a test that has to clean up after itself eventually does not, and a suite
 * that shares a directory between cases fails in an order-dependent way that
 * nobody can reproduce from the report.
