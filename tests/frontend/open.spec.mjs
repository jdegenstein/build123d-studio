/** What the editor refuses to open, and what it asks about first.
 *
 * Both guards run before the file is read, which is the half a unit test cannot
 * see: `filetype.js` is pure and says what the bytes mean, and nothing in it can
 * say whether the application then stopped. The assertions below are therefore
 * about what is on screen and what crossed the boundary - a tab that did not
 * appear, a read that did not happen - rather than about which function ran.
 *
 * The size case is deliberately not about the editor being slow. Measured in
 * this harness, a 32 MB file appears in a tab in 152 ms because Monaco
 * tokenises the viewport rather than the document; what costs is that the whole
 * buffer goes for analysis on open and after every edit. So the question is
 * asked, and answering it with Load is a perfectly ordinary thing to do.
 *
 * Proved by un-applying, once, when each case was written: the guard taken out
 * of the shipped source, the suite run, the file put back. What was removed,
 * and what went red:
 *
 * - src/editor/filetype.js, looksBinary()'s scan for a NUL - a file that is
 *   not text is refused, and is never read whole
 * - src/editor/filetype.js, isLarge() answering false - a large file asks,
 *   Load opens it, only the front is looked at, and an open tab is not asked
 *   about twice
 * - src/editor/files.js, the mayOpen() call in openPath - every case here
 *   except the ordinary file, which correctly stays green
