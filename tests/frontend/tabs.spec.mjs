/** Many files in one editor: the strip, the dirty mark, and what undo belongs to.
 *
 * `tabs.js` already tests label disambiguation as a pure function, and
 * `buffers.js` tests the registry with injected model operations. What neither
 * can reach is the part that went wrong on a real build: whether the mark the
 * user is looking at agrees with the answer the application gives when it
 * matters, and whether Monaco's undo stack stays with the file it belongs to.
 * Both need a real Monaco and a real strip, which is what this suite has.
 *
 * Proved by un-applying, once, when each case was written: the guard taken out
 * of the shipped source, the suite run, the file put back. What was removed,
 * and what went red:
 *
 * - src/editor/monaco.js, the dirty check's deferral to the next tick - the
 *   dirty mark goes away again, and the title agrees
 * - src/editor/monaco.js, one model per buffer back to one shared model - each
 *   tab shows its own file, the dirty mark, a clean tab closes
