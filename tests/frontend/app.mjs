 *   packaged application.
 * - `@neutralinojs/lib`, aliased to the in-memory stub at build time.
 * - the sidecar's WebSocket, answered by Playwright's own routing rather than
 *   by a server. The application still opens a real socket and still speaks the
 *   real binary frame protocol - `src/frame.js` encodes both ends, so the two
 *   cannot drift - but there is no process, no port to collide and nothing to
 *   clean up if a test fails half way.
 *
 * What is deliberately *not* faked: main.js, the panes, Monaco, the stylesheet
 * and the layout engine. A harness that replaced any of those would be
 * answering questions about itself.
