/** The four panes, their boundaries, and what a restart remembers about them.
 *
 * Everything here is about pixels the layout engine actually produced, which is
 * the whole reason this suite runs in a browser: `splitter.js` sizes panes by
 * writing computed pixel widths into custom properties, so what it got right or
 * wrong is only visible once something has measured a real container. A unit
 * test of the arithmetic would have agreed with the code in every case below,
 * including the one that shipped broken.
 *
 * Proved by un-applying, once, when each case was written: the guard taken out
 * of the shipped source, the suite run, the file put back. What was removed,
 * and what went red:
 *
 * - src/editor/sidebar.js, the `if (visible === away)` re-measure - starting
 *   with a folder open, and hiding the tree gives its width back
 * - src/layout/splitter.js, clamp() returning its argument - an absurd stored
 *   fraction is clamped
 * - src/layout/splitter.js, the persist() after a drag - moves it, and is
 *   remembered
