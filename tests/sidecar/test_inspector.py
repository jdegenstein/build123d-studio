"""The variable explorer's kernel half: what a row contains, and where it is.

This is the first test of `inspector`, which runs inside the kernel rather than
in the sidecar - so it is imported directly and handed a namespace, which is all
it ever reads. Everything it returns is a JSON string, deliberately, and these
parse it back: that round trip is part of what is being checked, because the
reason for the string is a printer on the far side that used to turn a long list
into a literal "..." and break every refresh from then on.

The example in the plan is the shape that mattered:

    a = dict(a=12, b="wert", c=[1,2,3,4,5,6], d=dict(x=dict(aa=1, bb="sdfg"), y=2))

Two levels of dict inside a dict inside a dict, which the pane could not reach
at all before: expanding a row showed one level of reprs and stopped.

    New in kind with subshells. Until an inspection could overtake the code the
    kernel is running, this module only ever saw a namespace standing still -
    the kernel was idle by definition, because the request that woke it was the
    inspection. Now a cell binding a name or appending to a dict is genuinely
    concurrent, and CPython raises RuntimeError for exactly that.

    Race widening, the technique Phase 3 used, in the one form available here.
    A thread that merely mutates loses nothing at all - measured, 0 out of 300 -
    because between two steps of the read the interpreter has no reason to
    switch threads. sys.setswitchinterval at a microsecond gives it one on
    almost every bytecode, which turns a window of microseconds into something
    lost about a third of the time. The churn also has to *grow* the container
    rather than add and remove: CPython compares the size now against the size
    when the iterator was made, so an add paired with a pop restores it and the
    check passes. Both of those were wrong in the first version of this test,
    and it passed against the unfixed code because of it.

    What is asserted is that no call returns a *wrong* answer - either it reads
    the dict, or it says the dict is changing. Silently reporting a dict that is
    being filled as having no children is the failure this excludes, and it is
