// There is no Windows machine, the packaging job for it has never run, and a
// quoting bug does not announce itself - it either works or it hands a shell
// something the author did not intend. Asserting the rules is the closest
// available thing to running them.
//
// The expectations below are what CommandLineToArgvW does, not what looks
// tidy: 2n backslashes before a quote yield n backslashes and end the argument,
// 2n+1 yield n backslashes and a literal quote.

// `strings bin/neutralino-win_x64.exe` contains the literal `cmd.exe /c "`, so
// every command this application builds is wrapped in one.
//
// The rules that matter, from `cmd /?`: with several quotes present, cmd strips
// the first and the last and parses what is left as a command line. In that
// text a `"` toggles a quoted region and *nothing escapes it* - a backslash is
// an ordinary character to cmd, so ArgvW's `\"` reads to cmd as a literal
// backslash followed by a quote that closes the region. Anything in `&|<>()`
// outside a quoted region then separates commands.
//
// That is the whole injection, and it says which character is dangerous: a
// value containing `&` but no `"` never leaves the quoted region and is inert.
// The quote is the only way out.
