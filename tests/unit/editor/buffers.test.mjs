// The bookkeeping behind many open files, with a fake model in place of Monaco's.
// What can be wrong here without a window: a buffer keeping another buffer's
// dirty flag, a closed model never being disposed, and a key outliving the
// buffer it named. The last two are the ones that hurt later - the leak is
// invisible until forty files have been opened, and a reused key hands one
// buffer's edits to another.
//
// Whether Monaco's alternative version id really returns to its earlier value on
// undo is Monaco's business and is documented; what is tested here is that this
// module compares against the right one.
