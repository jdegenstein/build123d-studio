  // The namespace these rows describe died with the backend. Showing them until
  // the replacement's first idle would be showing variables that no longer
  // exist, in a pane whose whole job is to say what does.
  //
  // A kernel restart is the same statement about the same rows, and it was not
  // handled here. It did not show, because until the refresh was gated on
  // execute_request the replacement console's kernel_info_request went idle,
  // any idle bought an inspection, and the pane was emptied by that. Gating the
  // refresh is right - a question the console asked cannot have changed the
  // namespace - but it took an accident with it that was doing real work.
  // Measured across the gating commit: two vars.data frames after a restart
  // before it, the last one empty; none after it, and the dead kernel's rows
  // still on screen.
  //
  // Emptied here rather than re-inspected, because a restarted kernel's
  // namespace *is* empty - that is what restart means - so there is nothing to
  // ask it. The next Run refreshes as usual.
