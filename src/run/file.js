// Ctrl-F5: run the file on disk, in a process of its own, with no debugger.
//
// The sibling of Shift-F5 rather than of F5's old meaning, and that is the
// distinction this module exists to make. Run All sends the *buffer's text* to
// the kernel, where its names stay in the namespace the console shares. Run File
// saves and runs the *file*, in a process that is gone when it ends - so what
// ran is what is on disk, and nothing is left behind.
//
// The panes swap exactly as they do for debugging, because the rule is the same
// one: while something else is running, every pane in the window describes that
// something else. The only difference is that there are no step controls, since
// there is nothing to step - which is also the only difference in VS Code.
//
// The viewer is the deliberate exception, as it is for debugging: a picture is
// not state, and a show() from the run reaches the viewer already on screen
// because the process is given the kernel's environment.
