// The native menu bar, as data.
//
// Its first job is copy and paste. Without a menu, macOS binds the standard
// editing shortcuts to nothing at all and Cmd-C in the console or a dialog
// simply does nothing - the keystroke is swallowed before the page sees it. The
// menu is the mechanism that gets it delivered, which is why this file exists.
//
// ## What the documentation guarantees, which is all this relies on
//
// From the Neutralino window API for setMainMenu:
//
//   text       the label; "-" is a separator
//   id         a unique identifier
//   action     a pre-defined native role, e.g. "copy:", "cut:", "paste:"
//   shortcut   binds on macOS as a single character with Command implied
//              ("c" is Cmd-C), and *only displays* on Windows and GNU/Linux
//   isDisabled greys the item out
//   menuItems  a submenu
//
// and a click emits mainMenuItemClicked.
//
// Two things follow, and they are limitations rather than choices:
//
// * Only a Cmd-plus-one-character chord can be shown on macOS. Shift-Enter and
//   F5 cannot be expressed at all there, so the Run items carry no shortcut on
//   macOS and carry a display string everywhere else. Monaco binds them in every
//   case - the menu is not what makes them work.
// * Off macOS the menu binds nothing. Its items still have to *work* when
//   clicked, which is what the ids and mainMenuItemClicked are for.
//
// ## What it deliberately does not rely on
//
// The documentation does not say what mainMenuItemClicked carries, whether the
// native roles exist off macOS, or whether an item with a role *also* raises the
// click event. That last one matters - a role and a handler both firing would
// paste twice - so nothing here has both, and the questions are settled by a
// build rather than by reading somebody's source.
//
// This module is pure so that the shape can be asserted without a window; the
// installing half is menubar.js. Same split as keys.js and keybindings.js.
