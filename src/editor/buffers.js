/**
 * Every open buffer, and which one the editor is showing.
 *
 * A buffer is a path, a Monaco model, the version id it had when it last matched
 * disk, and where the caret and viewport were when it was last visible. Until
 * now each of those was a single module-level value in monaco.js - `currentFile`,
 * the editor's one implicit model, `savedVersionId`, and nothing at all for the
 * view state, because with one buffer there is never anywhere to come back from.
 * The whole of "many files open" is that those four become a Map.
 *
 * It has since grown two more that are the same kind of thing - whether the file
 * underneath has gone, and what it looked like when this buffer last agreed with
 * it - and one of those is set after the buffer exists rather than at its
 * creation, because it comes from a stat rather than from the text.
 *
 * No monaco import here, deliberately. A model is an opaque handle and everything
 * this module does with one - make it, throw it away, read its text, replace its
 * text, ask which version it is on - arrives through initBuffers. That keeps the
 * bookkeeping testable under `node --test`, which cannot load the editor, and it
 * is the same
 * split as keys/keybindings and clipboard/editing: the decisions live in the half
 * that has no window.
