// Files: opening them, saving them, closing them, and remembering which were
// open.
//
// The largest module in the application and the one with the most reach, which
// is worth saying plainly rather than leaving to be discovered. Everything that
// puts a user's text on disk or takes it off passes through here, and the
// decisions that can cost somebody their work are made in this file even where
// the mechanics live elsewhere:
//
// - **safewrite.js** writes through a temporary, and puts the old contents
//   back if it has to fall back to a direct write; this file decides which
//   buffer's text is written, to which path, and when.
// - **ondisk.js** compares what is on disk with what a buffer agreed with; this
//   file records the stamps and asks the question before every write.
// - **journal.js** keeps a copy of unsaved work for an end that asks nobody;
//   this file books those copies, removes them once they are no longer the only
//   one, and offers them back at the next start.
// - **buffers.js** owns the bookkeeping; this file owns the lifecycle around it.
//
// The rule that shapes most of it: a save is not instant, and the window is
// live throughout. Anything sampled at the start of one and used at the end of
// it must be carried explicitly, by key, rather than asked for again - which is
// why saveBuffer takes a buffer key and never asks what is on screen.
//
// The workspace - which folder is open, which tabs, where the carets were - is
// read and written here too, and is deliberately paths only. What is *in* a
// buffer that has never been saved is the journal's job, not the workspace's.
