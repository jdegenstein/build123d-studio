// The folder tree.
//
// Lazy by construction: a directory's contents are read the first time it is
// expanded and not before. That is not an optimisation, it is what makes Open
// Folder usable at all - a CAD project is full of STEP and STL exports, and
// reading the whole hierarchy up front would hang the window on exactly the
// projects worth opening. filesystem.readDirectory takes a `recursive` option
// and this deliberately never passes it.
//
// What is read is cached, and kept current by watching the folder: an open
// project has one recursive watcher on its root, and anything that changes on
// disk re-reads the directories that are actually on screen. See watchFolder.
//
// Ordering, filtering and path joining are in tree.js, which has no DOM and is
// tested. This file is rows and clicks.
