// Rebuilt from the buffers rather than mutated, for the reason the menu is:
// a strip is a pure function of which buffers are open, which one is showing
// and which of them are dirty, and every bug in a mutated one is a transition
// somebody forgot. There are never many tabs, so rebuilding costs nothing worth
// measuring.
//
// The labels come from tabs.js, which has no DOM in it and is where the only
// real algorithm here lives - working out that two files called bracket.py need
// telling apart, and by how much.
//
// Overflow scrolls, which was decided rather than defaulted: a dropdown of what
// does not fit is a second place to look for a file that is already on screen
// somewhere, and the strip is horizontal anyway.
