// about the same. JSON is a language service -
// Monaco has no plain grammar for it - and costs about 850 kB minified
// (jsonMode 409 kB, its worker 430 kB, measured in the production build),
// loaded when the first JSON file is opened, not at startup. It adds syntax
// diagnostics to the highlighting, which for settings.json and snippets.json
// is what makes it worth that.

//

// toggleHighContrast, because this application chooses the editor's theme in
// theme.js and a command that swaps it underneath would leave the two
