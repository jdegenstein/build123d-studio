// codebase has wanted it, so it is the shape rather than a one-off.

// On Windows and GNU/Linux the Edit menu's items are ours to answer, and doing
// so means knowing which of three quite different things holds the caret: a
// Monaco model, an xterm.js terminal whose transcript is output and cannot be
// edited, or an ordinary input in a dialog. Deciding which is here; acting on
// it is editing.js. macOS needs neither, because its native roles find the
// focused thing themselves.
