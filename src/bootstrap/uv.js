// uv is downloaded on first start rather than bundled, and pinned to one exact
// release per build123d Studio release.
//
// Not bundled: it is 50 MB in every package, for a tool that has to be fetched
// on some platforms anyway.
//
// Pinned rather than "latest": a release of this application is a support
// target. When uv floated, two people running the same build123d Studio could
// have different uv versions and different CPython builds depending only on
// what was current the day each of them first started it - and "0.11.33 was
// published this morning" is not something a bug report ever mentions. A new
// uv now needs a new build123d Studio release, which is also when it gets
// tested.
//
// The checksums live in pins.json and are checked on every install. That is a
// stronger anchor than the .sha256 files uv publishes: those sit on the same
// release page as the archives, so whoever could replace one could replace the
// other - they prove the download is intact, not that it is the artifact this
// application was tested against. A digest committed to this repository is a
// statement we control.
//
// Provenance is verified once, when the pin is recorded, by a maintainer
// running gh attestation verify - not here. Doing it at runtime meant an
// unauthenticated GitHub API call on the first-start path that had to fail open
// when the API was unreachable or rate-limited, which made the strength of the
// check depend on the network. Verifying at pin time puts a human and a real
// Sigstore signature chain in the loop instead, and leaves this path with no
// network dependency beyond the download itself.
//
// Downloaded with curl rather than fetch(): the webview would need CORS
// permission from GitHub's asset host, which it does not grant. curl is present
// on macOS, on Linux, and on Windows 10 and later.
//
// Astral's own installer (`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`, or
// install.ps1 on Windows) would work too, and UV_UNMANAGED_INSTALL makes it
// install to a chosen directory without touching PATH. It is deliberately not
// used here. That script is built for a terminal - it writes a receipt, offers
// a self-updater, and edits shell profiles unless told not to, which is one
// wrong environment variable away from a GUI application silently rewriting
// someone's .zshrc. Fetching a named artifact and checking it against a digest
// we committed keeps the file inert until we choose to run it.
