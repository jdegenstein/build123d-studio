// the variable explorer, and it is deliberately drawn to look like Monaco's -
// the same border, the same hover, the same disabled grey - because a user does
// not care which library owns which pane.
//
// It is HTML rather than the platform's own menu for the reason the webview's
// menu had to be suppressed in the first place: a native menu comes with a
// Reload item that discards the editor buffer, and nothing in Neutralino's API
// offers a native menu with items of our choosing at a point. See reload.js.

// in clipboard.js, which imports nothing and is tested. This file positions a
// box and dismisses it.
