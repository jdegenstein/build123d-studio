// its own metadata. See runtime/pyproject.toml.

// line itself says where the package comes from.
//
// No attempt is made to police which combinations are compatible. uv refuses an
// unsatisfiable combination on its own and explains it better than a rule here
// could, and a failed change is rolled back rather than left to break the next
// start.
