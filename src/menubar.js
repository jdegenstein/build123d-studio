// Install the native menu and route what it sends back.
//
// menu.js decides the shape; this is the half that reaches Neutralino and the
// application's own commands. Split for the same reason keys.js and
// keybindings.js are: the shape is worth testing and Neutralino cannot be loaded
// under `node --test`.
//
// ## Three things the documentation does not answer
//
// It defines the menu item fields, the native roles and the mainMenuItemClicked
// event, and it stops there. It does not say what that event carries, whether
// the roles exist off macOS, or whether an item with a role *also* raises the
// event. Guessing at any of them would decide the design on a theory, so:
//
// * nothing depends on the payload's shape - the id is read out of whatever
//   arrives, in the two forms it could plausibly take, and an unrecognised
//   payload is logged in full rather than swallowed
// * an item never has both a role and a handler. On macOS the clipboard items
//   are roles and nothing here answers for them; everywhere else they are
//   handled here and carry no role. If the event did fire for a role as well,
//   the worst case is a log line, not a double paste
// * whether that is right on each platform is a question for a build, and the
//   log line is what will answer it
//
// ## What the menu is not
//
// It is not what makes the run shortcuts work - Monaco binds those, and on macOS
// the menu could not express them anyway. The Run items are there so the
// commands are discoverable and reachable with a mouse.
